## Roadmap

- Basics of Event Log Files and .evtx entension.

- Installing Python and python-evtx package.

- Windows Powershell Commands

- ArgParse package in Python - Working.

- Implementing evtx_dump.py using Commands in Powershell.

- Learn to build a basic Tkinter GUI Application.

- Try subprocess module API of Python as well.

- Implement the parsing algorithm in Tkinter Application.

- Say "Thank You" to me :D

  
## Installation and Deployment

- First of all, Install Python using Microsoft Store or python.org

- Next, using 'pip' install 'python-evtx' package, to install Evtx and other related packages that will be used in evtx_dump.py file.

```bash
  pip install python-evtx
```
- Clone this repository.
- Run the App by simply double-clicking it or using the command:
```bash
  python app.py
```
- The .evtx file you will find in the project is just a sample .evtx file. You can view your own .evtx files by going to: C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs


## Documentation

argparse and Evtx package used in evtx_dump.py are used to parse the binary xml object extracted from .evtx file.

Methods used in [app.py]():
- open_file(): helps in placing an open file dialog box and saving the path of .evtx file selected.
- Run_button(): takes the file address as argument, uses subprocess API module to push the command into command prompt.  
- open_xml(): takes output xml file location as argument. Has two environment dependent variables that you would have to change. one is browser_location and other is pathadd. Add the location of your browswer.exe from Program Files into browser_location. Add the path address of Tkinter in your pc in pathadd.
